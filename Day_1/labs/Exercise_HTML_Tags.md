# Exercise: Create Webpage With All HTML Tags

## Objective


1. Open `index.html`
2. Using [this page](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/basic_site.html) and [this page](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/html_lists.html), create a webpage with an ordered list, unordered list, definition list, headers, paragraphs, images, links, tables, blockquotes and footers.


Once you're done with that you can go through one of the list provided and use every HTML tag in your page(by following the numbers below), and/or add tags for grouping([using this page as a guideline](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/more_tags.html)).

1. Create a new HTML file called `tags.html`
2. Go to either [this page](https://goo.gl/bwNFFH) or [this page](https://goo.gl/UVmY9Q).
3. Go through the list on the pages linked above and add every single HTML tag to your page. Don't worry about adding the deprecated tags.
