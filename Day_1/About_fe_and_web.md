# About frontend and the web

## What is frontend?
When talking about front-end people are usually talking about what people see and interact with. The three main languages of frontend are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
In the last few years the lines of frontend and backend have blurred because of things like node.js which allows people to develop full applications with technically no backend.

Note: Frontend, front-end, front end…all of these are accepted spellings according to the people who write dictionaries for a living.

## How the Web Works
