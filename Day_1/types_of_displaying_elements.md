# Types of displaying elements

There are three default ways for elements to be displayed.
- block
- inline-block
- none

**block** elements(such as `<p>` and `<div>`) will take up all the the width available, with a new line before and after so it will be the only element on one line.

**inline-block** elements(such as `<a>` and `<img>`) will only take up as width that's necessary for it, with no new lines so it can have multiple elements on one line.

**none** elements(such as `<meta>` and `<style>` will not be rendered at all.
