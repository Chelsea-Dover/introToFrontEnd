## Objective
Recreate layouts using flexbox.


**Codepen** Do the following steps if you plan to use Codepen.
- Create a new Pen called flexbox
- Go to this link [here](https://github.com/Chelsea-Dover/front-end-101/blob/master/CSS_Day_3/labs/flexbox_lab/flex.html) and paste the HTML from that page into the HTML section of your pen and delete everything outside of your body tags
- paste the following CSS in the CSS section of your pen:

```
section {
            border: solid 2px;
            margin: 3px;
            display: flex;
        }
        div {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            border: dashed 2px;
            margin: 10px;
        }
        section section {
            border: dashed 2px;
        }
```

- In your your CSS section using flexbox and [this page](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/flexbox.html) as a reference make your page match.

**Atom** Do the following steps if you plan to use Atom.

- Create a new HTML file called `flexbox.html`
- Create a new CSS file called `flexbox_style.css`
- Go to this link [here](https://github.com/Chelsea-Dover/front-end-101/blob/master/CSS_Day_3/labs/flexbox_lab/flex.html) and paste the HTML from that page into your `flexbox.html` file.
- Link up your CSS file to you HTML file using the `link` tag in you HTML `head`(if both your HTML file and CSS file are in the same place the link would be `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="flexbox_style.css">`)
- In your your CSS section using flexbox and [this page](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/flexbox.html) as a reference make your page match.
