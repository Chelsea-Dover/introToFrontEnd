# Exercise: Recreate responsive menu in CSS

## Objective
Get a good foundation of responsive design in CSS.

You don't have to touch the JS. Just realize that what it's doing is toggling the class on the `ul` between `navShow` and `tavtop`.


- Go to [this pen](https://codepen.io/Chelsea-Dover/pen/KXaMjO/) and fork it (the 'fork' button is in the top right corner).
- Go [here](https://codepen.io/Chelsea-Dover/full/ggbdyV/) and in your pen match the styles when the menu shrinks and expands and when the hamburger button is clicked.

**What to do if you're done**

- Continue working on your personal webpage.
- Go [here](https://github.com/Chelsea-Dover/introToFrontEnd/blob/master/Day_5/labs/all_zens.md) pick a zen mockup and do it.
