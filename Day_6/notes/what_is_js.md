#What is JavaScript?
JavaScript(or JS) is a programming language that allows you to manipulate web pages and add levels of complexity. Every web page that is more than just a static site has Javascript.

A way I like to think of it is like a house.
- HTMl is the structure. So all the walls and really the foundation is HTML.
- CSS is the paint and carpet and everything visual that makes it pretty
- JS is the electricity. So all the lights and the electric stove and everything that really brings the home to life is the JS.

JavaScript is a computer programming language. A computer programming language at it's most basic is a list of instructions for the computer to execute. These instructions are called statements. In JavaScript each statement is separated by semicolons:

e.g.
```
var x;
x = 1;
```
