# Basic History of Javascript
- JavaScript, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich who was then working at netscape.
- JavaScript was originally named Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted.
- Javascript has nothing to do with Java. It was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.
