# What is CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is meant to be paired with a markup language( like html or xml) and it wonâ€™t render anything without them.

Where HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. CSS brings a webpage to life by choosing fonts, applying colors, defining margins, positioning elements, animating interactions, and much more.
