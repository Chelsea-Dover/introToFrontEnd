# Exercise: Start adding style to your webpage!

## Objective

Start adding custom style to your webpage using an external stylesheet.

1. Create a new CSS file called `style.css` in the same folder that your index.html page is in
1. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` to the head of your html file
1. Create your portfolio using the styles we've gone over. You must at least include:
    - background
    - margin
    - color
    - padding

## Bonus points

- Play around with using selectors and the hierarchy rules to have styles override each other
- Go through [this list](https://goo.gl/ZAgbis) and/or [this list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and play around with more styles
