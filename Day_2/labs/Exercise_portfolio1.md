# Exercise: Start creating your personal portfolio

## Objective

Start creating your personal portfolio with that tags we've gone through. Don't worry about the content too much in class.

1. Create a new HTML file called `index.html`
1. Go to [this file](https://github.com/Chelsea-Dover/front-end-101/blob/master/HTML/boilerplate.html) and paste the boilerplate into your HTML file.
1. Create your portfolio using the tags we've gone over. You must at least include:
    - Some kind of list such as `ol`, `ul`, `dl`
    - `img` element
    - Header such as `h1`, `h2`, `h3`
    - link or anchor(`a`) to your form webpage
    - Paragraph(`p`) element
    - Blockquote(`blockquote`) element

## Bonus points

- Add more tags of varying types
- Try adding inline styles using the attribute `style`
