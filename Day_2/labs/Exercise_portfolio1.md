# Exercise: Start creating your personal webpage!

## Objective

Start creating your personal webpage with that tags we've gone through. Don't worry about the content too much in class.

1. Create a new HTML file called `index.html`
1. Go to [this file](https://github.com/Chelsea-Dover/introToFrontEnd/blob/master/Day_1/boilerplate.html) and paste the boilerplate into your HTML file.
1. Create your own webpage using the tags we've gone over. You must at least include:
    - Some kind of list (`ol`, `ul`, `dl`)
    - Image(`img`) element
    - Header such as `h1`, `h2`, `h3`
    - link or anchor(`a`) to your form webpage and any other html files you have made.
    - Paragraph(`p`) element
    - Block quote(`blockquote`) element
    - Table(`table`, `tr`, `th`, `td`)
