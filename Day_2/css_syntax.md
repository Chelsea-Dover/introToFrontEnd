# CSS Syntax

CSS works by following these steps:
1. Selecting an HTML element
2. Choosing a property to alter
3. Applying a value

Each pair of properties and values are called declarations.
Each declaration is separated by semicolons as shown below.
```
p {
    background: red;
    border: solid;
    width: 500px;
}
```

Just like in HTML you can add comments in CSS. The syntax for that is a forward slash and then a star, followed by the content you want in the comment and ending with a mirror of the opening(a star followed by a forward slash)

e.g.

/* this will not be rendered */
