# Basic history of CSS

As use of the web increased and grew in popularity, as did people's desire for more unique webpage designs. At the time, resources for adding styles to websites were quite sparse. There were a few HTML tags such as `<basefont>` and `<strike>` and there were a few attributes such as `bgcolor` and `text`. Developers also used tables to hack layouts.

These were a step in the right direction but it became a long process to add style to every page and it was very hard to maintain.

In 1994 HÃ¥kon Wium Lie published the first draft of the Cascading HTML Style Sheets proposal. Since then it has grown to what it is today.
