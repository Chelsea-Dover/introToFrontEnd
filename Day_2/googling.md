#Googling for Solutions

----------------------
Before asking me for help, you should search the internet on your own for help. People have asked and answered many questions on the internet already.

Think of an English, slightly abstract description of your problem.
Add what language or markup language you're using to the beginning.

Examples:

 > HTML table
 > CSS gradient background

## Places that have good answers:

There's lots of places to get answers online. Here's some popular sites that you'll most likely come across on your search.

### W3Schools:
    W3Schools is a very popular site with working and editable code examples and tutorials.
    I personally find this useful for HTMl & CSS.

### MDN
    MDN is another very popular site for learning Open Web technologies.
    I personally find this most useful for Javascript & jQuery.

### CSS-Tricks
    CSS-Tricks is a site with tips and tricks for Cascading Style Sheets.
    I find it very helpful for more complex CSS.

### StackOverflow
    StackOverflow is a Q&A website for programming.
    You may not see this come up as much for CSS and HTML but as you start using programming languages such as Javascript you'll start to see it more often.
